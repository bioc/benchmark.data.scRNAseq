"pollen","The Pollen dataset was generated from 11 populations usingmicrofluidics. The authors analyzed single-cell transcriptomesacross downsampled sequencing depths, in order to demonstratethat shallow single-cell mRNA sequencing (âˆ¼50,000 reads per cell)is sufficient for unbiased cell-type classification andbiomarker identification.","0.1.0","hg19","BAM","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP041736","Aug 02 2014","Homo sapiens",9606,TRUE,"SRA","Wachter, A. <astrid.wachter@abbvie.com>","Large SingleCellExperiment","Rda","benchmark.data.scRNAseq/pollen.rda","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2967"
