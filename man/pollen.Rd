\description{
The Pollen dataset was generated from 11 populations using
microfluidics. The authors analyzed single-cell transcriptomes
across downsampled sequencing depths, in order to demonstrate
that shallow single-cell mRNA sequencing (âˆ¼50,000 reads per cell)
is sufficient for unbiased cell-type classification and
biomarker identification.
